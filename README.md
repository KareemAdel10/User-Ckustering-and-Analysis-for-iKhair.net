# User Segmentation and Analysis for iKhair.net
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and segmenting users of the iKhair.net mobile app, which has over 10 million records of user profiles, transactions, and locations since its launch in 2011. The primary goal is to group users based on behavioral similarities and generate actionable insights through data analysis and visualization.

## Objectives
1. Data Analysis: Analyze two datasets (Users and Transactions) to segment users and identify behavior patterns, including:
  - Creating 3 user segments based on similarities.
  - Calculating the average transaction value per segment.
  - Determining the top purchase day and peak purchase hour.
  - Identifying the top 10 donors based on transaction value.
2. Dashboard Creation: Build an interactive dashboard in Looker Studio to visualize findings, including:
  - Date and project name filters.
  - Percentage of purchases by organization.
  - Purchase activity trends (daily and monthly).
  - Top five user activities.
